Design a target code generator given the parser you have designed in
Assignment 3 as input. The target code generator should produce MIPS
assembly code as output. The generated code should be compatible with and
executable on the MIPS simulation platform SPIM. Also, incorporate type
(int should be coercible into chars) and nested scope analysis on the
given input parser. If you cannot handle the entire parser created by you
in assignment 3, take the largest subset of it that you can handle.
