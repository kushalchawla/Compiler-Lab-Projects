# Compiler-Lab-Projects

Project 2 - 
The language has the following features - 

o Global declarations for both functions and variables (c declaration should be fine and simple.)

o Usual mathematical expressions (bracketing, +, -, *, /, unary negation (eg: -2))

o Have Integers and Boolean types

o Looping options

o Conditionals

o Should allow all kinds of nesting.

o Type checking.

o Input/Output commands

o Recursion.


Part 1 

A C program to do the following : 

Input: A regular expression on the alphabet {a,b...}. 
Output: The minimal DFA for the regular expression 

In addition, a program to simulate the DFA on any possible input!

Part 2

Grammar(tentative) for the language we have designed. 
Identification of the tokens! 
A lex code which will produce the tokens for the language!
