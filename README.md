Compiler lab projects

Project 2 - 
We will be designing a language and building a compiler for it in

this course. This task will be broken down into a series of

assignments.

The language you design must have the following features

o Global declarations for both functions and variables (c declaration should be fine and simple.)

o Usual mathematical expressions (bracketing, +, -, *, /, unary negation (eg: -2))

o Have Integers and Boolean types

o Looping options

o Conditionals

o Should allow all kinds of nesting.

o Type checking.

o Input/Output commands

o Recursion.


Part 1 

Write a C program to do the following: 

Input: A regular expression on the alphabet {a,b...}. 

Output: The minimal DFA for the regular expression 

In addition, we must write a program to simulate the DFA on any

possible input.

Part 2

Write the grammar(tentative) for the language we will design. The

language we will design should be presented at a .txt or .pdf file.

Identify the tokens. Write a lex code which will produce the tokens for

your language.
